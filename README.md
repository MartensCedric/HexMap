# Hexmap
Java library that allows to build hexagonal maps. 
The main advantage of Hexmap is that you have the option to make *Freeform* maps. This means it is not necessarily squared or hexagonal as most hex-grid libraries offer. You could make your map in any shape you want!

Currently Hexmap is WIP since most of it was used to create Hexpert, an Android game. Since Hexpert's needed Hexmap features are done, I've left Hexmap's development to focus on Hexpert.
